# Scheme interpreter

A Scheme interpreter implemented in Haskell. This project aims to provide a simple, efficient, and extensible interpreter for the Scheme programming language.

The program supports interactive REPL for parsing and evaluating Scheme code and environment management for variable bindings and function definitions.

## The interpreter supports key features of Scheme
1. Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, etc.)
2. Conditional expressions (if, cond)
3. List manipulation (car, cdr, cons, etc.)
4. Lambda functions and function application
5. Built-in functions: map, filter, length, reverse, etc.
